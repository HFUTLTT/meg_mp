Master Thesis - Signal Analysis of Gamma Brain OscillationsRecorded with Low-Tc and High-Tc Squid-Based Magnetoencephalography -A Matching Pursuit Approach

This repository includes the full code used for teh project implementation:
1. Custom Matlab code for MEG signal Analysis in the folder "matlab -> SpectralAnalysis".
2. Matching pursuit dyadic and stochastic dictionary implementations from:
   Subhash  Chandran  KS,  Ashutosh  Mishra,  Vinay  Shirhatti,  and  Supratim Ray.  Comparison of matching pursuit algorithm 
   with other signal processing  techniques  for  computation  of  the  time-frequency  power  spectrum  of brain signals.

3. Fieldtrip toolbox for Matlab. Latest versions available at http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/.
   Note: the fieldtrip.zip folder must be extracted to yield the folder "matlab -> fieldtrip".
4. Full-sized images for plots generated using the code.
